    "- We have used `if else` statements to control logic flow\n",
    "- We have used some functions from sympy like `Rational(1,10)` to show 1/10\n",
    "- We have started to search for syntax by ourselves when building python code\n",
    "- We also learnt a number of operators. Including the equality operators `==` and `!=` and `*, /, %`\n",
