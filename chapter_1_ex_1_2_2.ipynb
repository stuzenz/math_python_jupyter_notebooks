    "- So far in these exercises we have iterated a `list` several times\n",
    "- We have done a number of `for value in range(1,10,1)` type loops\n",
    "- We have converted strings to values using `eval()` for evaluation and we have converted values to strings for print statements by using the `str()` function.\n",
    "- We have used `if else` statements to control logic flow\n",
    "- We have used some functions from sympy like `Rational(1,10)` to show 1/10\n",
    "- We have started to search for syntax by ourselves when building python code\n",
    "- We also learnt a number of operators. Including the equality operators `==` and `!=` and `*, /, %`\n",
    "- We even mentioned `+=` a comment in our code which is something we may start to use going forward\n",

    "## In the next section\n",

    "- We will be looking at factors, prime factors, lowest common multiples and highest common factors.\n",
    "- We will be learning more about the methods available from sympy to use python as a replacement for a calculator\n",
    "- We will start to do more things with lists and start looking at a different data structure called 'dictionaries' or 'dicts' for short"
