# Companion site for [primes.page](https://primes.page)

The jupyter notebook repository is to be used with the [primes.page](https://primes.page) website

The objective of the website is to give 11 - 16 year olds a way to use python with their maths studies.

Students who use the site should learn:

- Some study skills;
- Some maths; and
- Some python skills

The study material is approachable for 11 year olds if they have some 1-to-1 support with a parent.

Although a cloud environment is available to run these notebooks (from the *launch binder* button below or the [primes.page](https://primes.page) website, if you have time, please follow install instructions for jupyter-lab to allow you to run the notebooks directly from your machine.

The cloud environment is still an excellent option if you do not have the time to set up a working jupyter-lab environment or if you are using a chromebook device.

Enjoy and good luck!
